* First things first
At this points we expect that you:
- have installed the framework in your personal computer and 
- have run ALL the tests and ALL of them passed.
If that is not the case then please go back to the installation
instructions which you can find in the main webpage of the project in
the =github= repository [[https://github.com/tachidok/chapchom][here]], or in the README.md file at the root
folder of the project.

** A framework, not a library
Contrary to how a library works, where you are in charge of the main
flow of the program and the tools that you include, this project is
intented to be a framework, that means, we provide you with the main
code structure and you only have to fill in the specific details of
for your project.

The code you write becomes part of the framework which provides you
with the tools required for your project. You are always free to
personalise the framework based on your needs by extending, but not
modifying, its current behavior. It means, you may extend, without
modifying, the framework with your own implementations to provide it
with extra functionalities.

** Folder structure of the framework
This is what each folder is about in the framework:
- =bin=, stores scripts used by the framework at compilation time,
  there are also scripts that help on the generation of *clean
  distributions* of the framework. These are compressed files that you
  may want to generate when copying the framework to a computer
  without Internet access; a supercomputer node.
- =build=, this folder is automatically generated when compiling the
  library and all the compilation files are stored there. You do not
  need to deal with the files within this folder, just leave them
  alone.
- =configs=, store configuration files, each file corresponds to an
  specialised configuration of the framework. The default configuraton
  is stored in the =default= file. If you want to use an specialised
  configuration of the framework you should store it here and select
  it at compilation time when prompting for a /configuration file/. If
  you are curious try any other of the configurations in this folder,
  some of them make use of external libraries so make sure you have
  installed them.
- =demos=, stores a set of examples that you may want to use as
  templates or starting points for your project. These demos provide a
  good insight on the features available in the framework. This folder
  also helps for testing the framework and report any found issues
  after new features are implemented.. All demos must compile, run and
  pass the tests to perform a /push/ operation to the official
  repository.
- =external_src=, this folder stores any external library packages
  used within the framework to provide extra features. You should not
  modify this folder unless you are providing new functionalities that
  depend on external software packages.
- =private=, stores private files for each user/collaborator of the
  framework. Each user/collaborator should have its own private folder
  here, this should be used as the development folder of each
  user. The users may move their own developments (prior authorisation
  of the main collaborators) to the demo folder such that the
  applications become part of the demos of the framework that shown
  specialised features of the framework.
- =src=, the hearth of the framework, here lies all the source code of
  the framework. You should create new files in this folder only if
  you are adding new functionalities to the framework. Otherwise, you
  should be doing fine with working only in your =private= folder.
- =tools=, a set of tools used for the library, mainly for
  visualisation issues.

** Running demos
Go to the demo folder you are interested and type =./bin/= followed by
the name of the demo. Make sure there is a =./RESLT/= folder in the
directory you are running the demo since the results of the
computations are stored in there.

Once the demo has started you should see output messages on the
terminal with general information about the results of the
computations.

*** Input arguments
Some demos require input arguments to run, you can check what input
arguments you need to pass by passing the =--help= or =-h= option to
the demo driver.

** Create your =private= folder
In order to modify or create your own code we encourage you to do so
in your own private folder, to do so open a terminal and create your
folder inside the =private= folder.

In a terminal type

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd private
mkdir bob
cd bob
#+END_SRC

Note that we are assuming you are named =bob=, change that with your
name. Once you have created your own private folder update the
=CMakeLists.txt= file in the private folder by adding your folder name
at the end of the file using the following line

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(bob)
#+END_SRC

Substitute =bob= with your folder name.

Compile again the full framework using the =./autogen.sh= comand at the
root folder and make sure no problems are found.

* Creating your own project into the framework
Start by copying a demo driver into your private folder, here we copy
the demo driver =demo_basic_interpolation.cpp= in the folder
=/demos/interpolation/basic_interpolation=. Assuming you are in your
private folder type the following in a terminal

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cp demos/interpolation/basic_interpolation/demo_basic_interpolation.cpp demo_bob.cpp
#+END_SRC

Then copy the =CMakeLists.txt.user_template= file that lives in the
=tools= folder into your private directory and change its name to
=CMakeLists.txt=, then chage its content as follows:

+ All the instances of the tag =SRC_demo_bob= for your own tag to
  identify source code.
+ All the instances of =demo_bob.cpp= for the name of your code file.
+ All the instances of =demo_bob=, this is the name of your executable
  and the name you need to type to compile your project.
+ All the instances of the tag =LIB_demo_bob= for your own tag to
  identify libraries required for your code
+ Include the libraries you need. In the example only the
  =general_lib= and the =problem_lib= are included (in section # there
  is a list for the name of the libraries that you may include into
  your project).
+ DONE

Compile again the full framework using the =./autogen.sh= comand at
the root folder and make sure no compilation errors are found. Once
compilation has finished without errors you can compile your code by
going to the =/build/= folder and type

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make demo_bob
#+END_SRC

The compilation output should be displayed in your screen. Fix any
compilation problem you found, then to run your code go back to your
=private= folder, make sure you have a =RESLT= folder in your
directory and type

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./bin/demo_bob
#+END_SRC

Any output from your code should be displayed on the terminal.

** Compilation or source code and exection of binaries
As you have noticed, the generation and execution of your project is
made in two different folders:
+ the =build= folder and
+ your =private= folder.
We followed this two-folders strategy to avoid having automatically
generated =CMake= files all over the folder structure of the
project. By following this strategy we keep a cleaner structure for
the project and group all files generated by =CMake= in the =build=
folder. This help us to keep track of changes easily since we can
exclude the =build= folder from the =git= repository.

Thus keep in mind that whenever you want to compile your source code
you need to do so in the =build= directory, just type =make= followed
by the name of your project. Then, to execute your project go back to
your =private= folder and type =./bin/= concatenated with the name of
your executable file.

* Add your project as a demo into the =demo= folder and create a unit test
The main steps to include your project into the =demo= folder are as
follow:
+ Create the required folder structure into the =demo= folder.
+ Add =ADD_SUBDIRECTORY= lines in the corresponding =CMakeLists.txt=
  files to include your newly created folder structure.
+ Copy the =CMakeLists.txt.demo_template= file into the demo folder
  and rename it to =CMakeLists.txt=.
+ Create a =validate= folder into the newly created folder structure
  for your demo.
+ Store the expected/correct output files generated by your demo in
  the =validate= folder. The validation files should be named as
  =validate_double_demo_bob.dat= and =validate_demo_bob.dat= changing
  =bob= by the name of your project. Please generate double and single
  precision validation files by running your project with both
  configurations.
+ Rename the same tags and variables as in =* Creating your own
  project into the framework= section.
+ Rename ALL instances of =TEST_demo_bob_run= by the name of your
  demo. Keep the =TEST= and =_run= prefix and postfix, respectively.
+ Rename ALL instances of =demo_bob= with the name of your demo.
+ Rename ALL instances of =VALIDATE_FILENAME_demo_bob= with the name
  of your tag for the validation file.
+ Change the name of the validation file
  =validate_double_demo_bob.dat= by yours, this file should have the
  expected/correct output of your project using double precision.
+ Change the name of the validation file =validate_demo_bob.dat= by
  yours, this file should have the expected/correct output of your
  project using single precision.
+ Rename ALL instances of =TEST_demo_bob_check_output= by the name of
  your demo. Keep the =TEST= and =_output= prefix and postfix,
  respectively.
+ Make sure that your demo generates an output file named
  =output_test.dat= with the information that will be checked by the
  testing process.

* Include the =bin= folder of the project to your =PATH= variable

Add the following lines at the end of your =.bashrc= file in your home
folder.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export PATH="/home/tachidok/local/working/research/chapchom/bin/:$PATH"
#+END_SRC

Assumming the working directory of the library is at

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
/home/tachidok/local/working/research/chapchom/
#+END_SRC
